## Introduction

The "Othmane-Data LLC Sales Performance Dashboard 2023" provides an in-depth analysis of the company's sales, gross profit, and other key performance indicators (KPIs). The dashboard uses various visualizations to track progress year-to-date (YTD) versus the prior year-to-date (PYTD), identify areas of growth and decline, and assess profitability by country, product type, and account segmentation.

## Dashboard File
