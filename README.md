## Introduction

The "Othmane-Data LLC Sales Performance Dashboard 2023" provides an in-depth analysis of the company's sales, gross profit, and other key performance indicators (KPIs). The dashboard uses various visualizations to track progress year-to-date (YTD) versus the prior year-to-date (PYTD), identify areas of growth and decline, and assess profitability by country, product type, and account segmentation.

### ‚ùé Conclusion and Recommendations:

#### Conclusion

This dashboard provides a detailed analysis of key HR metrics, offering valuable insights into employee demographics, satisfaction, attrition, and workforce distribution. The data reveals notable trends, such as a male-dominated workforce (60%), a high concentration of employees in the Research & Development department (64.93%), and significant attrition (230 employees). While job satisfaction is relatively higher in the Life Sciences field, it varies widely across educational backgrounds. The dashboard also highlights business travel trends, with the majority of employees traveling rarely.
